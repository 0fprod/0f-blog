In this article, we're going to delve a bit deeper into persistent storage on EVM-compatible blockchains[^1]. In other languages, it's not necessary to know what happens at a low level in order to write efficient code, but in the case of Solidity (which is not quite a high-level language), it is important â€“ though not essential â€“ to know this, because operations cost gas.

Gas is the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations on the blockchain. In _Ethereum_, we have a transactional model, and each transaction requires computation to be executed and validated, so a fee (gas) must be paid. In this table fragment, we can see the cost associated with each operation (opcode); we can see that accesses to **Memory** (MLOAD & MSTORE) are much cheaper than accesses to **Storage** (SLOAD & STORE).

| Opcode | Name    | Description            | Extra Info | Gas       |
| ------ | ------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| ...    | ...     | ...                    | -          | ...       |
| 0x51   | MLOAD   | Load word from memory  | -          | 3\*       |
| 0x52   | MSTORE  | Save word to memory    | -          | 3\*       |
| 0x53   | MSTORE8 | Save byte to memory    | -          | 3         |
| 0x54   | SLOAD   | Load word from storage | -          | 800       |
| 0x55   | SSTORE  | Save word to storage   | -          | 20000\*\* |
| ...    | ...     | ...                    | -          | ...       |

## Memory & Storage

In _Solidity_, there are two types of storage: volatile (Memory), which can be thought of as RAM, and persistent (Storage), which can be thought of as a hard drive.

- **Memory**: Variables defined in the body of functions (whether or not they contain the **memory** keyword) are temporary; they only exist within the _scope_ of that function, and they are deleted when the function execution ends until the next execution, where a new storage space is allocated.

```solidity
contract Foo {
  // State variables
  uint8[] foo;

  function bar(string memory _bar, bool _foo) public {
        // Memory variables
        uint8 baz = 10;
        // Copy of foo, modifications to _baz doesn't affect the foo state
        uint8[] memory _baz = foo;
    }
}
```

- **Storage**: Variables defined outside of functions are considered persistent by default (known as state variables). These variables persist on the blockchain.

```solidity
contract Foo {
  // State variables
  uint8[] foo;

  function bar() public {
      // Reference to foo, modifications to _baz alters the foo state
      uint8[] storage _baz = foo;
    }
}
```

## Storage & SmartContracts

All Smart Contracts running on the EVM have a permanent Storage associated with them, which is part of the blockchain's global state. This _Storage_ can be seen as a list of _key-value_ pairs ordered by their declaration in the Smart Contract, with each element being 32 bytes in size, and a total size of 2^256. While the Storage is large enough to store anything, it initially costs nothing since it's all set to 0. In Ethereum, you pay for everything that's not 0 and for memory expansions.

The **order in which variables are declared is relevant** in Solidity, and they're usually not grouped by domain or other criteria, but by size and type for the EVM's convenience.

Let's take a look at this contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract StoragePlayground {
  // State  variables
  uint256 favNumber; // Storage at slot 0
  bool someBool;     // Storage at slot 1

  constructor() {
    favNumber = 5;
    someBool = true;
  }
}
```

To inspect the state of the Storage, we can use the [getStorageAt](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-getStorageAt) function provided by the provider (in this case, we'll use ethers). We pass it the address of a contract and the memory slot of the data we want to retrieve. This function allows us to examine the contents of the Storage at a specific slot, which can be useful for debugging and analyzing Smart Contracts on the blockchain.

```typescript
// Pseudocode to deploy the smart contract locally
function deployContract() {
  console.log('Deploying StoragePlayground...');
  const contract = await deploy('StoragePlayground', {...});

  for (let slot = 0; slot < 5; slot++) {
    let content = await ethers.provider.getStorageAt(contract.address,slot)
    console.log(`${slot} -> ${content}`)
  }
}
```

This piece of code prints out to the console the first 5 slots in the contract storage.

```bash
0 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005
1 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
2 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
3 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
4 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

As expected, the number 5 was stored in position 0 and True in position 1.

If we change the data type of `favNumber` from `uint256` to `uint8` we can see how they share a memory slot:

```bash
0 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000105
1 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
2 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
3 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
4 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

We can see that the size and type of variables must be taken into account. The [rules](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/internals/layout_in_storage.html#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage) for declaring variables efficiently are defined in the Solidity documentation.

## Arrays & Mappings

Now let's see some examples using arrays (fixed-size and dynamic) and mappings[^2].

Fixed-size arrays are stored in consecutive positions. We can verify this using the same method as before:

```solidity
contract StoragePlayground {
  // State variables
  uint256 favNumber; // Storage at slot 0
  bool someBool; // Storage at slot 1
  uint256[3] myArray; // Storage slots 2,3 and 4

  constructor() {
     favNumber = 5;
     someBool = true;

     myArray = [10, 20, 30];
  }
}
```

We see that the data stored at slots 2, 3 and 4 are the hexadecimal values of 10, 20 and 30 `(0x00..a, 0x00...14 and 0x00...1e)`

```bash
0 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005
1 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
2 -> 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a
3 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
4 -> 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e
```

And what about dynamic arrays? How does the EVM know how many slots to reserve between variables?

Well, it doesn't know ðŸ˜…, and to solve this it uses a hash function _keccak256_, to find a memory position and not overwrite other slots. Let's change the code a bit to add a dynamic array. Reemplazamos `uint256[3] myArray` con `uint256[] myArray`. The rest of the code remains the same with the same 3 elements.

```bash
0 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005
1 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
2 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003
3 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
4 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

We can see that they're gone,but in position 2 we have stored the number 3, which represents the length of the array and gets updated as elements are added. However, the slot where it is stored remains the same, which is slot 2. To calculate the position from which the array data is stored, the function `keccak256(slot-where-the-array-length-is-stored)` is used. Ethers provides us with this function:

We know that it is in slot 2 (0x2 in hexadecimal). With `hexZeroPad`, we fill in 0s to the left until we reach 32 bytes (64 zeros).

```typescript
const arrayLengthSlot = ethers.utils.hexZeroPad('0x2', 32);
// 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002
const firstElementSlot = ethers.utils.keccak256(arrayLengthSlot);
// 0x405787fa12a823e0f2b7631cc41b3ba8828b3321ca811111fa75cd3aa3bb5ace
```

Now, if we call `getStorageAt` with that slot, we will get the first item stored in the array:

```typescript
let content = await ethers.provider.getStorageAt(contract.address, firstElementSlot);
// 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a
```

We see that the hexadecimal value of 10, our first element! Now the next elements are stored in a sequentiall order. So if we add 1 to the position of the first element we get the second.

```typescript
// 0x405787fa12a823e0f2b7631cc41b3ba8828b3321ca811111fa75cd3aa3bb5ace
// + 1
// 0x405787fa12a823e0f2b7631cc41b3ba8828b3321ca811111fa75cd3aa3bb5acf
//                                                                  ^
const secondElementSlot = '0x405787fa12a823e0f2b7631cc41b3ba8828b3321ca811111fa75cd3aa3bb5acf';
content = await ethers.provider.getStorageAt(contract.address, secondElementSlot);
// 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```

Which is 20 in hex. And the third element is in the next one:

```typescript
// 0x405787fa12a823e0f2b7631cc41b3ba8828b3321ca811111fa75cd3aa3bb5acf
// +1
// 0x405787fa12a823e0f2b7631cc41b3ba8828b3321ca811111fa75cd3aa3bb5ad0
//                                                                 ^^
```

Finally, we will see an example with mappings.

```solidity
contract StoragePlayground {
  // State variables
  uint256 favNumber; // Storage at slot 0
  bool someBool; // Storage at slot 1
  mapping(uint256 => bool) dictionary; // Storage at slot 2
  address private someAddress; // Storage at slot 3

  constructor() {
    favNumber = 5;
    someBool = true;
    someAddress = 0xaA3052db3062D60643682B1272d00A6BF4A6f5E6;
    dictionary[10] = true;
    dictionary[20] = false;
    dictionary[30] = true;
  }
}
```

In this output, we see that slot 2 is completely empty, unlike the dynamic array, here the length of the mapping is not stored because it is not iterable, and its keys do not have to be consecutive.

```bash
0 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005
1 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
2 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
3 -> 0x000000000000000000000000aa3052db3062d60643682b1272d00a6bf4a6f5e6
4 -> 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

```

However, to calculate the memory position to store the data, it does something similar to arrays. In this case, the [formula to apply is this](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/internals/layout_in_storage.html#mappings-and-dynamic-arrays): `keccak256(h(k) . p)`. Where `h` is a function based on the type of the key, `k` is the dictionary key, `p` is the memory slot of the mapping, and `.` is the concatenation of both.

```typescript
// Convert to hexadecimal the slot 0x2 and the dictionary key
const p = ethers.utils.hexZeroPad('0x2', 32);
const keyAsHex = ethers.BigNumber.from(10).toHexString();
const h_k_ = ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(keyAsHex, 32);

// Concat
const concat = ethers.utils.concat([h_k_, p]);

// Apply hash
const concatHash = ethers.utils.keccak256(concat);

// Get the date
const valor = await ethers.provider.getStorageAt(contract.address, concatHash);

// This would be the output of concatHash and the value for the 3 keys
// dictionary[10] = true
// 0xd3604db978f6137b0d18816b77b2ce810487a3af08a922e0b184963be5f3adfc
// 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

// dictionary[20] = false
// 0x50d9dffd10eb4437a15e8bb1c50afee98ea231805f136fb9a057e7aaeec448ae
// 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

// dictionary[30] = true
// 0x6ea47ca2f9e3a67b0e336c514aa9f125109f49309b7162caec32e7d27e5c838c
// 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

## getStorageAt

As a curiosity about this function, it allows us to access the contents of a memory slot in a contract's storage. If you think about it, you can see everything, as long as you have access to the contract, you can see in which slot something is stored.

As seen in the last example, there are public variables (by default) and private ones (those that have the `private` 3121prefix), so using this function, you can see them all if you have access to the contract code and simply count in which slot the variable is defined. So remember, never store sensitive data in the blockchain.
