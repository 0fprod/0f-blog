          <p>
            I graduated in 2017 as a software engineer and have been diving into the tech world ever since. I'm all
            about football, blockchain, and full-stack development, especially in the Web3 space. I had the opportunity
            to share insights as a speaker at JavaScript Day Canarias in2023 about web3 development tools and how to
            write decentralized applications compatible with EVM.

            With over 7 years of delivering professional software. I've been tinkering with everything from front end
            applications, back-ends to smart contracts and always trying to follow the best practices. I'm a huge
            advocate for automated testing; it gives me that extra confidence boost. For me, it's all about writing
            quality, straightforward code that's easy to maintain and adapt.
          </p>
          <p>And speaking of adaptability, successful software should be able to evolve effortlessly, right?</p>
